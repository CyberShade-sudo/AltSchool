Objective
The goal of Phase 1 was to set up a complete PKI (Public Key
Infrastructure) hierarchy with a root CA, intermediate CA, and server
certificates to establish a trusted TLS environment.

1. Root Certificate Authority (CA) Creation
I created a Root Certificate Authority (CA) on my Kali VM using OpenSSL.
A 4096-bit RSA key was chosen for the Root CA because it provides strong
security and is a widely accepted standard for long-term trust anchors.

2. Intermediate CA and Certificate Issuance
An Intermediate CA was generated and signed by the Root CA to form a
trust chain. The Intermediate CA was then used to issue certificates for end
entities, including:
• One server certificate (used to secure server communications)

3. SSH Keypair Generation and Host Configuration
Two SSH keypairs were generated on Kali:
• RSA 4096-bit key — chosen for compatibility with systems that
require RSA keys and to ensure strong encryption.
• Ed25519 key — chosen for its modern design, smaller key size, faster
operations, and strong security guarantees.
The host system was configured to accept one of the keys (RSA) for secure
remote logins. This demonstrates practical application of asymmetric
cryptography in system access control.
• Public SSH key (id_rsa.pub).

4. Key Generation Documentation
All OpenSSL and ssh-keygen commands used in the creation of the Root
CA, Intermediate CA, certificates, and SSH keypairs were documented. The
choice of key types and sizes was justified to balance security strength with
performance and compatibility.
